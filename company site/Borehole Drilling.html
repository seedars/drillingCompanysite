                    <h3> DOMESTIC BOREHOLE </h3>
                </div>
                <p>There are many reasons for considering having a water supply borehole on your property. Your spring
                    may be becoming unreliable during dry weather or contaminated by animals / human or ions upstream.
                </p>
                <p> You may already have mains water but be at the extremity of the supply line and have a low pressure
                    at peak times. Or you may simply wish to be independent and free from any of the issues that can
                    arise from being dependent on the mains water supply.</p>

                <p>A water supply borehole will overcome these problems by providing a reliable, consistent flow of
                    clean water with constant volume and pressure. </p>



                <div class="h1-headings">
                    <h3>THE BENEFITS </h3>
                </div>
                <p>In Nigeria, borehole is nasality due to a volatile mains water supply in part of Abuja and no mains
                    supply in other State, run a small farm with high water bills or just like the idea of being free
                    from the constraints of a water company, a domestic borehole could be the solution for you.</p>

                <p>Whether it is for washing facilities or drinking water, switching from mains supply to a private
                    water supply can offer many benefits. These include:
                    <li> Major cost savings </li>
                    <li>Constant flow and pressure in demand periods</li>
                    <li>Reliable water quality</li>
                    <li> Reduced reliance on external supplies</li>
                </p>






                <div class="h1-headings">
                    <h3>UNDERSTANDING DOMESTIC BOREHOLES </h3>
                </div>

                <p> is usually a once in a lifetime event that someone buys a water supply borehole and
                    therefore it is important that the procedures and cost implications are made clear
                    at the outset.</p>

                <p>At Seedars we handle everything from Geophysical documentation, Drilling through
                    construction, installation of pumping equipment, commissioning, analysis of the
                    groundwater produced and installation of a treatment system where necessary. But in
                    some situation the client’s might have done their Geophysical survey, we do pickup
                    the job as per client requirements. </p>

                <p>You may wish to carry out trench work from your property to the borehole location for
                    water pipe and electricity cabling.</p>

                <p>For further information please complete the contact form below and we will answer any

                    survey of the proposed borehole location and detailed discussion on your exact
                    requirements to firm up our offer.</p>

                <p>If you are happy with this offer, we will require that you sign a contract to
